# Kaleidoscopable Zoobkas Pack
A pack of zoobkas you can process with the kaleidoscope filter to make your own zoobkas.

The GIMP kaleidoscope filter is found in menu Filters>Distorts>Kaleidoscope...

Do not confuse this with G'Mic's kaleidoscopes.

All the images the name of which starts with k-ewD are 1920x1080. Otherwise they are 1366x768.

TIP: Flip vertically any of these before applying the kaleidoscope to get different results.
